# tiberqueries
A lightweight ORM for [Tiberius](https://github.com/prisma/tiberius). 

Implements includes derive functionality as well as a trait implementation for the Client. The goal is not to be a query builder and rather to just make mapping your types simple. 

If you are looking for a query builder for SQL Server try [CANYON-SQL](https://github.com/zerodaycode/Canyon-SQL).
